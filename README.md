# Melanoma Detection Using CNN

> This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect melanoma from a dataset of skin cancer images. The goal is to accurately classify images into different skin cancer types to assist in early diagnosis and treatment.

## General Information
- **Background**: Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that can be fatal if not detected early. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival rates.
- **Business Problem**: Accurate and timely diagnosis of melanoma is crucial for effective treatment. This project addresses the need for a reliable automated system to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive, containing a variety of labeled skin images. The dataset includes multiple classes such as actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.

## Conclusions
- The CNN model achieved a test accuracy of 0.939, indicating strong performance in classifying skin cancer images.
- Data augmentation techniques were employed to balance the dataset and improve model generalization.
- The model's performance metrics suggest that it can be a valuable tool for assisting in the early detection of melanoma.
- Further tuning and additional data could help in improving the model accuracy and robustness.
